With Anaconda
=============

To install with Anaconda, we recommend you install it in a `conda environment
<https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_
with the `Miniconda distribution <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_. In
the Anaconda Prompt, terminal, or Command Prompt, create an environment and activate
it::

   conda create --name kp-env python=3.9
   conda activate kp-env

If you prefer a graphical interface to manage packages and environments, you can install
the `Anaconda distribution <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda>`_ instead.

Installing::

    conda install kikuchipy --channel conda-forge

To update kikuchipy to the latest release::

    conda update kikuchipy

To install a specific version of kikuchipy (say version 0.5.8)::

    conda install kikuchipy==0.5.8

.. _install-with-pip:

With pip
========

kikuchipy is availabe from the `Python Package Index
<https://pypi.org/project/kikuchipy/>`_ (PyPI), and can therefore be installed with `pip
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable>`_. To do so, run the following in the Anaconda Prompt,
terminal or Command Prompt::

    pip install kikuchipy

To update kikuchipy to the latest release::

    pip install --upgrade kikuchipy

To install a specific version of kikuchipy (say version 0.5.8)::

    pip install kikuchipy==0.5.8

Some dependencies are made optional and are available via the following selectors:

- ``viz``: 3D plot of master patterns using `pyvista <https://docs.pyvista.org/>`_

Installing optional dependencies::

    pip install kikuchipy[viz]

========================

The easiest way to install kikuchipy is via the HyperSpy Bundle. See `HyperSpy's
documentation

for instructions.

.. warning::

    kikuchipy is updated more frequently than the HyperSpy Bundle, thus the installed
    version of kikuchipy will most likely not be the latest version available. See the
    `HyperSpy Bundle repository <https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy-bundle>`_ for how
    to update packages in the bundle.

<https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy>`_, and install with ``pip``::

    git clone https://github.com/pyxem/kikuchipy.git
    cd kikuchipy
    pip install --editable .

See the :ref:`contributing guidelines <setting-up-a-development-installation>` for how
