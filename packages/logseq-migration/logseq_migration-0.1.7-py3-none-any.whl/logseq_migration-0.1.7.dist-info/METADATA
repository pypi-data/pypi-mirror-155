# logseq-migration

**Download and use local copies of assets in logseq after importing a file from roam**.

Roam stores the assets (images, pdfs, mp4 files etc.) in the cloud.

While `logseq` makes it easy for you to import a roam `json` export, your _assets_ will remain in the cloud.

That worries me, because

2. I want to store all the data that I own in my local file system.
3. I want to be able to view my pages even if I am not connected to the Internet.
4. The assets could disappear if roam research ceased trading or changed its policy about closed accounts.

So I adapted the code from [here](https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210602-downloading-files-from-roam/) 
to suit `logseq` instead of `Obsidian`, wrote some minimal tests and refactored the code.

## It's currently _beta_ software 

It's had limited testing, but it worked for me on a graph with about 1800 nodes.

Once installed, you can run the code each time you want to process a recently imported
roam graph.

Since the program messes with the markdown in your pages (in order to make asset links local),

**back up your graph before you run this code!**

The application is easy to install and run.
You'll find instructions below.

## Installation

### Install required software

#### Python 3

The code is written in Python, and you  will need an installed copy of Python3.8 or later.

If you don't already have a suitable copy of Python installed, you'll find installation instructions
[here](https://www.python.org/).

#### pip3

`pip` is Python's package manager. You'll need `pip3`, the version that supports Python3.

This is normally installed with Python3. If it isn't for some reason you can follow
[these instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Install the application

run `pip3 install logseq-migration`

### Run the application

run `localise_assets <vault_dir>`

where `vault_dir` is the directory in which your `logseq` graph lives.

You should see a list of the firebase urls and the asset file names as they are saved.

The code is [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence).
In other words, if you run it two or more times, nothing _should_ change after the first run.

Let me know how you get on, and please raise an issue if there are problems, 
or you want to suggest new features.

There's a [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and a [project journal](plan/journal.md). If you're interested in contributing, get in 
touch.
