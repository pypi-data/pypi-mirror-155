"""Module for aggregating results

For example, when you need to decide whether a cat or a dog is in the picture, and you ask more than one performers.
In this case, you need to decide on the final answer and sometimes calculate the probability. This module will help you do this.
Aggregation works on the Toloka server side.

In these cases, we strongly recommend using our [crowd-kit](https://github.com/Toloka/crowd-kit) solution.
It will allow you to:
- use more different aggregation methods,
- perform aggregation on your side
