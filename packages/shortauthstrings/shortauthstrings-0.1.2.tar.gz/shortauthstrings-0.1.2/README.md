# Short authentication strings for Python

This package implements rendering of short authenticated strings, which you
can use in your application after an unauthenticated exchange such as a
Diffie-Hellman process.  The usual way in which this works is, both sides
of the exchange display (hopefully) the same sequence based on the shared
key (or a derivative of it), indicating that the shared key is, in fact,
shared.

See [module](src/shortauthstrings/__init__.py) for more documentation.
