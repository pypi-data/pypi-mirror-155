class SubstructureGenerateFrequency:
    """A SubstructureGenerateFrequency object is used to define the modes to be used in a modal
    dynamic analysis. These modes are selected from the specified frequency range including 
    the frequency boundary. 

    Attributes
    ----------
    lower: float
        A Float specifying the lower limit of the frequency range, in cycles/time.
    upper: float
        A Float specifying the upper limit of the frequency range, in cycles/time.
