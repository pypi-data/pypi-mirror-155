class Leaf:
    """Leaf objects are used to specify the items in a display group. Leaf objects are
    constructed as temporary objects, which are then used as arguments to DisplayGroup 
    commands. 
    Leaf objects have similarities to Set objects; however, Leaf objects are evaluated when 
    the DisplayGroup expression is evaluated, and they can have SymbolicConstant values 
    (which are also evaluated when the DisplayGroup expression is evaluated).
