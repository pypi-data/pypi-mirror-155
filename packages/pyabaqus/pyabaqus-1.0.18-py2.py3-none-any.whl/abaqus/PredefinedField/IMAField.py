    Attributes
    ----------
    region: Region
        A :py:class:`~abaqus.Region.Region.Region` object specifying the sub-region of the selected part instance to which the
        volume fractions will be applied.
    discFieldList: tuple
        A tuple of Strings specifying the name of the discrete fields that contain the volume
        fraction data. The length of the tuple corresponds to the number of material instance
        names, as established by the assigned Eulerian section.
