        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            A String specifying the repository key. 
        crackDomain
            A Region object specifying the region that contains the crack or is likely to contain 
            the crack. 
        allowCrackGrowth
            A Boolean specifying whether the crack is allowed to propagate (grow). The default value 
            is ON. 
        crackLocation
            A Region object specifying the initial crack location. This parameter is required when 
            *allowCrackGrowth*=OFF. 
        singularityCalcRadius
            None or a Float specifying the radius from the crack tips within which the elements are 
            used for crack singularity calculations. This argument applies only when 
            *allowCrackGrowth*=OFF. The default value is None. 
        interactionProperty
            A String specifying the name of the ContactProperty object that defines the contact 
            properties for the crack surfaces. The default value is an empty string. 
        elemId
            A sequence of Ints specifying the labels of the elements that are intersected by the 
            initial crack location. This argument is used only by the input file reader. 
        nodeId
            A sequence of Ints specifying the position of a node in the corresponding element 
            connectivity. This argument is used only by the input file reader. 
        hasCrackFront
            A sequence of Ints specifying the values indicating the inclusion/exclusion of the 
            *crackFrontDist* values. A zero value indicates that *crackFrontDist* is not specified 
            for the ith pair *elemId* and *nodeId*. This argument is used only by the input file 
            reader. 
        crackPlaneDist
            A sequence of Floats specifying the values of the first signed distance function. This 
            argument is used by the input file reader. 
        crackFrontDist
            A sequence of Floats specifying the values of the second signed distance function. This 
            argument is used only by the input file reader. 
        autoDetectValue
            An integer specifying the number of element layers around the crack location, to which 
            the crack domain is shrunk. 

        Returns
        -------
            A XFEMCrack object.
