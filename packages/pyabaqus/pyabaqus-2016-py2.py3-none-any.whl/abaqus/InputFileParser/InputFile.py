        Parameters
        ----------
        organize
            A Boolean specifying whether keywords should be organized into suboptions. The default 
            is False. 
        verbose
            A Boolean specifying whether verbose output is to be printed. If *verbose* is True, 
            information about fatal errors is printed. If no fatal errors occur, there is no output. 
            The default is False. 
        bulk
            A Boolean specifying whether the input file includes bulk data that should be parsed. 
            The default is True. 
        usePyArray
            A Boolean specifying that parse method can return an AbaqusNDarray object for a keyword 
            data value. In cases where large amounts of numerical data (i.e., large node arrays) are 
            expected, it is recommended that you use the option usePyArray=True. The default is 
            False. 

        Returns
        -------
            A KeywordSequence object. 

        Raises
        ------
            If you parse an input file more than once, a ValueError is raised for each subsequent 
            parsing.
