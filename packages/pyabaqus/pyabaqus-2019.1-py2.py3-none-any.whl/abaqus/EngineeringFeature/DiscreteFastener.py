        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            A String specifying the repository key. 
        region
            A Region object specifying the region to which the fastener is applied. 
        influenceRadius
            The SymbolicConstant WHOLE_SURFACE or a Float specifying the coupling influence radius. 
        ur1
            A Boolean specifying whether to constrain rotational displacement component about the 
            1-direction. The default value is ON. 
        ur2
            A Boolean specifying whether to constrain rotational displacement component about the 
            2-direction. The default value is ON. 
        ur3
            A Boolean specifying whether to constrain rotational displacement component about the 
            3-direction. The default value is ON. 
        coupling
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the coupling method used to couple the displacement and 
            rotation of each attachment point to the average motion of the surface nodes within the 
            radius of influence from the fastening point. Possible values are CONTINUUM and 
            STRUCTURAL. The default value is CONTINUUM. 
        weightingMethod
            A SymbolicConstant specifying the weighting scheme to be used to weight the contribution 
            of the displacements of the surface nodes within the radius of influence to the motion 
            of the fastening point. UNIFORM, LINEAR, QUADRATIC, and CUBIC indicate uniform, linear 
            decreasing, quadratic polynomial decreasing, and cubic polynomial monotonic decreasing 
            weight distributions. Possible values are UNIFORM, LINEAR, QUADRATIC, and CUBIC. The 
            default value is UNIFORM. 
        localCsys
            None or a DatumCsys object specifying the local coordinate system of fastener couplings. 
            If *localCsys*=None, couplings are defined in the global coordinate system. When this 
            member is queried, it returns an Int. The default value is None.
