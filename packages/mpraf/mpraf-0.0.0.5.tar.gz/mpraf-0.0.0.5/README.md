# MPRAF

MPRAF(Multi-layer Puzzle Recommendation Algorithm Frame) is a frame used for hybrid recommendation algorithms. Everyone can build their own hybrid algorithms with the architecture given by this frame to fix or solve specific shortcomings.

This is only a preview version, later stable version is coming soon.

## Input Layer

In this layer, read the file at first, and transform them into the specific format that we need. The MPRAF provides the solutions for reading and processing data.
