    API endpoint for Financial Contract analytics,

    Parameters
    ----------
    instrument_tag : str, optional
        User defined string to identify the instrument.It can be used to link output
        results to the instrument definition. Only alphabetic, numeric and '- _.#=@'
        characters are supported.
    start_date : str, optional
        Start date of the repo, that means when the the underlying security is
        exchanged.
    end_date : str, optional
        End date of the repo, that means when the borrower repurchases the security
        back. Either end_date or tenor field are requested.
    tenor : str, optional
        tenor that defines the duration of the Repo in case no end_date has been
        provided. In that case, end_date is computed from start_date and tenor. Either
        end_date or tenor field are requested.
    day_count_basis : DayCountBasis, optional
        Day Count Basis convention to apply to the custom Repo rate.
        By default "Dcb_Actual_360".
    underlying_instruments : list of UnderlyingContract
        Definition of the underlying instruments. Only Bond Contracts are supported for
        now, and only one Bond can be used.
    is_coupon_exchanged : bool, optional
        Specifies whether or not intermediate coupons are exchanged.
        - CouponExchanged = True to specify that intermediate coupons for the underlying
          bond (between the repo start date and repo end date) are exchanged between the
          repo seller and repo buyer.
        - CouponExchanged = False to specify that no intermediate coupons are exchanged
          between the repo seller and repo buyer. In this case the repo instrument is
          like a standard loan with no intermediate coupons; the bond is only used as a
          warranty in case the money borrower defaults. True by default, which means
          coupon exchanged.
    repo_rate_percent : float, optional
        Custom Repo Rate in percentage. If not provided in the request, it will be
        computed by interpolating/extrapolating a Repo Curve.
