##### Plugins to load
#
# Load these plugins. The directory containing xloil.dll is searched
# first, then the normal DLL search path order.
#
Plugins=[]

#
# Load any plugins in the same directory as the the XLL which 
# match this pattern.
#
PluginSearchPattern="xlOil_*.dll"


##### Log file settings 
#
# Intensity of logging, choose from:
# "trace", "debug", "info", "warning", "error", "critical", "off"
#
LogLevel="warning"

#
# The log file is created at <name-of-xll>.log in the same directory
# unless specified below
#
#LogFile="my.log"

##### Date
#
# The date formats xlOil will attempt to parse for a string to date
# conversion. Syntax follows C++ get_time here: 
# https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/manip/get_time
# Note the date parsing is case sensitive because get_time is case 
# sensitive on Windows.
#
#DateFormats=["%Y-%m-%d", "%Y%b%d"]

#
# This section may be removed if the xlOil DLLs are distributed in the
# same directory as the XLL addin.
#
# Use [[]] syntax because the order of Environment variables matters
# The key XLOIL_PATH is edited by the install script
