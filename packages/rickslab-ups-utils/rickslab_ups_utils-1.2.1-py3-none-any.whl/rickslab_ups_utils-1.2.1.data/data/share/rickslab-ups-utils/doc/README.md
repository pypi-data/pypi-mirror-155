# rickslab-ups-utils

A set of utilities to monitor and react to the status of a set of supported UPSs.

## Installation

There are currently 3 possible ways of installing *rickslab-ups-utils* as summarized here:

* [Repository](https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/ups-utils/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md#repository-installation) -
You can always clone the repository and run that version. This is useful if you want to contribute to the project.

* [PyPI](https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/ups-utils/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md#pypi-installation) -
Meant for users wanting to run the very latest version.  All **PATCH** level versions are released
here first.  This installation method is also meant for users not on a Debian distribution.

  [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/rickslab-ups-utils)](https://pepy.tech/project/rickslab-ups-utils)
* [Rickslab.com Debian](https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/gpu-utils/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md#rickslabcom-debian-installation) -
  Lags the PyPI release in order to assure robustness. May not include every **PATCH** version.

## User Guide

For a detailed introduction, a community sourced
[User Guide](https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/ups-utils/blob/master/docs/USER_GUIDE.md)
is available. All tools are demonstrated and use cases are presented.  Additions
to the guide are welcome.  Please submit a pull request with your suggested additions!

## Commands

### ups-ls

This utility displays most relevant parameters for installed and compatible
UPSs listed in the config.json file.  By default, all available parameters
are displayed. The *--input* and *--output* options can be used to get relevant
UPS input and output parameters.  With the *--list_commands* option, the
utility will list all available SNMP commands for the configured UPS.  With
the *--list_params* option, the daemon configuration parameters will be listed.
The *--list_decoders* option will display list of all MiB decoders available
for the UPS defined as daemon target. The *--verbose* will cause informational
messages to be displayed and *--no_markup* option will result in plain text
output instead of color coded text.  The logger is enabled with the *--debug*
option.

### ups-daemon

With no options specified, the utility will give the current status of the
UPS configured with *daemon = true* in the ups-config.json file. With the
*--daemon* option, *ups-daemon* will continuously check the status of the
UPS.  When it detects that the UPS is sourcing powering from the battery,
it will check the amount of time it has been running on battery and run
the specified suspend script when the specified threshold is exceeded.  It
will execute the specified resume script when it detects power has resumed.
When the utility detects a Battery Low event from the UPS or that time
remaining for battery or the battery charge is below specified thresholds,
then the shutdown script will be executed. If *ups-daemon* detects a return
to line power has occurred before the shutdown has completed, it will
execute the cancel shutdown script.  With the *--verbose* option set,
event update messages will be output, otherwise, only events are output.
The *--no_markup* option will cause the output to be in plain text, with
no color markup codes. The *--logfile filename* option is used to specify
a logfile, but is not implemented at this time.  The threshold and script
definitions must be made in the config.py file using *config.py.template*
as a template.  The logger is enabled with the *--debug* option.

### ups-mon

A utility to give the current state of all compatible UPSs. The default
behavior is to continuously update a text based table in the current window
until Ctrl-C is pressed.  With the *--gui* option, a table of relevant
parameters will be updated in a Gtk window.  You can specify the delay
between updates with the *--sleep N* option where N is an integer > 10 that
specifies the number of seconds to sleep between updates.  The *--log*
option is used to write all monitor data to a psv log file.  When writing
to a log file, the utility will indicate this in red at the top of the
window with a message that includes the log file name.  The *--status*
option will output a table of the current status.  By default, unresponsive
UPSs will not be displayed, but the *--show_unresponsive* can be used to
force their display.  The logger is enabled with the *--debug* option.

## New in Current Release  -  v1.2.1 

* Fixed issue in referencing PyPI install resource paths.

## Known Issues

The utility currently supports:

* APC UPS with AP9630 and AP9641 NMC
* EATON UPS with PowerWalker NMC.  I had an issue with voltage interpretation, and
found that PowerWalker does not support the use of their NMC with Eaton UPS.  But it 
mostly works anyway.

It monitors the specified UPSs using snmp v2c.  I have not implemented the
ability to listen to snmp traps yet, as I still have some research to do.
If you have different UPS and would like to extend the dictionary in this
[code](https://github.com/Ricks-Lab/ups-utils/blob/master/UPSmodules/UPSmodule.py)
to support it, feel free to make a pull request.

## History

## New in Previous Release  -  v1.2.0

* Delay sys exit on failure to allow more information to be available for user to troubleshoot.
* Check file permissions for security issues and exit if not secure.
* Determine installation type (Local Git Repository, PyPI, or Debian), and force use
  of Debian location for configuration files if it is a debian installation.
* The ups-utils.ini file is now only required for ups-daemon.  Other utilities will
  use defaults if missing.
* Added verbose option to ups-daemon to output status message for normal readings.
* Changes in documentation to describe steps necessary to secure snmp shared secret.
* Added check of configuration files readability.
* Implement code improvements from gpu-utils project.
* Move listing like functions from *ups-daemon* to *ups-ls*.
* Complete rewrite.
* USR1 signal will cause *ups-mon* and *ups-daemon* to reread daemon ini file.
* Moved logic of daemon parameter color coding to the daemon class.

### New in Previous Release  -  v1.0.0

* Initial Release - Full functionality and working debian package!
