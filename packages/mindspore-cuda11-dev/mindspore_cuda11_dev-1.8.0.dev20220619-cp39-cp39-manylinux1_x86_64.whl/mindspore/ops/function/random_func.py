def standard_laplace(shape, seed=0, seed2=0):
    r"""
    Generates random numbers according to the Laplace random number distribution (mean=0, lambda=1).
    It is defined as:

    .. math::
        \text{f}(x) = \frac{1}{2}\exp(-|x|),

    Args:
        shape (tuple): The shape of random tensor to be generated. Only constant value is allowed.
        seed (int): Random seed. Default: 0.
        seed2 (int): Random seed2. Default: 0.

    Returns:
        Tensor. The shape that the input 'shape' denotes. The dtype is float32.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If neither seed nor seed2 is an int.
        TypeError: If shape is not a tuple.
        ValueError: If shape is not a constant value.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> from mindspore.ops import functional as F
        >>> shape = (4, 4)
        >>> output = F.standard_laplace(shape)
        >>> result = output.shape
        >>> print(result)
        (4, 4)
