This library includes a print funtion that slows down the showing of output in console, character by character, as though typed by a typewriter.


## Getting started

Install the library with:

```sh
pip install -U snail_print
```

### Usage

Moreover, every console log in this video was made with the library and with [this file](https://github.com/Baelfire18/snail_print/master/presentation.py)

## Documentation

### snail_print

```python
function snail_print(*objects, delay=0.1, sep=" ", end="\n")
```

#### Parameters

+ `objects`: Can be any or even multiple python objects.

The objects whose string representation will be "snail printed".

+ `delay`: `float` or `int`, default `0.1`.

The delay, measured in seconds, between the printing of each character in `object`.

+ `sep`: `str`, default `" "`.

In case of having multiple arguments, one sep will be placed between each and the next.

+ `end`: `str`, default `"\n"`.

The final character of the print. By default creates a new line.


## Testing

```sh
python -m unittest tests
```
