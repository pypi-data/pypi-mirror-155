**A python package for model visualization.**


-   Free software: MIT license
-   Documentation: https://pinshuai.github.io/modvis
    

## Features

-   Visualize model outputs from hydrologic models including ATS, PFLOTRAN, and etc.
-   Plot unstructured meshes with variables such as groundwater table, saturation, and evapotranspiration.
-   Evaluate model performance using different metrics.

## Installation

`ModVis` is available on PyPI. To install, run the following command:

```
pip install modvis
```

## Quick start

To plot variables on the surface mesh:

```python
import modvis.ats_xdmf as xdmf
import modvis.plot_vis_file as pv

# import visdump file
visfile = xdmf.VisFile(model_dir='.', domain='surface', load_mesh=True)

# plot surface ponded depth
pv.plot_surface_data(visfile, var_name="surface-ponded_depth", log=True,
                              time_slice="2019-05-01", vmin=0.01, vmax=4)
```

## Examples

Jupyter notebook examples can be found under [examples/notebooks](./examples/notebooks)
