Mava is a library for building multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) systems. Mava builds off of Acme and in a similar way strives
to expose simple, efficient, and readable components, as well as examples that
serve both as reference implementations of popular algorithms and as strong
baselines, while still providing enough flexibility to do novel research.
