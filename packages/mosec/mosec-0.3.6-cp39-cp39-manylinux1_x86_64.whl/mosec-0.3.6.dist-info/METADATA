              subsequently incorporated within the Work.        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  <i>Model Serving made Efficient in the Cloud.</i>
</p>

## Introduction

Mosec is a high-performance and flexible model serving framework for building ML model-enabled backend and microservices. It bridges the gap between any machine learning models you just trained and the efficient online service API.

- **Highly performant**: web layer and task coordination built with Rust 🦀, which offers blazing speed in addition to efficient CPU utilization powered by async I/O
- **Ease of use**: user interface purely in Python 🐍, by which users can serve their models in an ML framework-agnostic manner using the same code as they do for offline testing
- **Dynamic batching**: aggregate requests from different users for batched inference and distribute results back
- **Pipelined stages**: spawn multiple processes for pipelined stages to handle CPU/GPU/IO mixed workloads
- **Cloud friendly**: designed to run in the cloud, with the model warmup, graceful shutdown, and Prometheus monitoring metrics, easily managed by Kubernetes or any container orchestration systems
- **Do one thing well**: focus on the online serving part, users can pay attention to the model performance and business logic

## Installation

Mosec requires Python 3.7 or above. Install the latest [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/mosec/) with:

```shell
> pip install -U mosec
```

## Usage

### Write the server

Import the libraries and set up a basic logger to better observe what happens.

```python
import logging

from mosec import Server, Worker
from mosec.errors import ValidationError

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
formatter = logging.Formatter(
    "%(asctime)s - %(process)d - %(levelname)s - %(filename)s:%(lineno)s - %(message)s"
)
sh = logging.StreamHandler()
sh.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(sh)
```

Then, we **build an API** to calculate the exponential with base **e** for a given number. To achieve that, we simply inherit the `Worker` class and override the `forward` method. Note that the input `req` is by default a JSON-decoded object, e.g., a dictionary here (wishfully it receives data like `{"x": 1}`). We also enclose the input parsing part with a `try...except...` block to reject invalid input (e.g., no key named `"x"` or field `"x"` cannot be converted to `float`).

```python
import math


class CalculateExp(Worker):
    def forward(self, req: dict) -> dict:
        try:
            x = float(req["x"])
        except KeyError:
            raise ValidationError("cannot find key 'x'")
        except ValueError:
            raise ValidationError("cannot convert 'x' value to float")
        y = math.exp(x)  # f(x) = e ^ x
        logger.debug(f"e ^ {x} = {y}")
        return {"y": y}
```

Finally, we append the worker to the server to construct a `single-stage workflow`, and we specify the number of processes we want it to run in parallel. Then we run the server.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = Server()
    server.append_worker(
        CalculateExp, num=2
    )  # we spawn two processes for parallel computing
    server.run()

```

### Run the server

After merging the snippets above into a file named `server.py`, we can first have a look at the command line arguments:

```shell
> python server.py --help
```

Then let's start the server...

```shell
> python server.py
```

and in another terminal, test it:

```console
> curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/inference -d '{"x": 2}'
{
  "y": 7.38905609893065
}

> curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/inference -d '{"input": 2}' # wrong schema
validation error: cannot find key 'x'
```

or check the metrics:

```shell
> curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics
```

For more debug logs, you can enable it by changing the Python & Rust log level:

```python
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

```shell
> RUST_LOG=debug python server.py
```

That's it! You have just hosted your **_exponential-computing model_** as a server! 😉

## Example

More ready-to-use examples can be found in the [Example](https://mosecorg.github.io/mosec/example) section. It includes:

- Multi-stage workflow
- Batch processing worker
- Shared memory IPC
- Customized GPU allocation

<sup>\*As accessed on 08 Oct 2021. By no means is this comparison showing that other frameworks are inferior, but rather it is used to illustrate the trade-off. The information is not guaranteed to be absolutely accurate. Please let us know if you find anything that may be incorrect.</sup>

<sup>**(1)**: Data format of the service's request and response. "Limited" in the sense that the framework has pre-defined requirements on the format.</sup>
<sup>**(2)**: Supported machine learning frameworks. "Heavily" means the serving framework is designed towards a specific ML framework. Thus it is hard, if not impossible, to adapt to others. "Multiple" means the serving framework provides adaptation to several existing ML frameworks. "Agnostic" means the serving framework does not necessarily care about the ML framework. Hence it supports all ML frameworks (in Python).</sup>
<sup>**(3)**: Flask is a representative of general purpose web frameworks to host ML models.</sup>
