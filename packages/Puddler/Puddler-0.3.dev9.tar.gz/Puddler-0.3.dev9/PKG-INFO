### Currently, in buggy alpha state?
___

### Installation:
```
$ python -m pip install Puddler --upgrade
$ python -m puddler
```

**Latest update:**
+ puddler now creates actual device id's, meaning you can use the script on multiple devices without getting cursed
+ fixed errors occurring, when the session list gets flushed. You can now safely update your server without worrying about stuff like that (unless api points get changed)

#### On the subject of *puddler in path*: This kind of puddler might get discontinued/replaced


###### with a better version ofc (not python)
___

### Information:

Currently, only the most basic features (+discord presence).

But at least both emby and jellyfin are supported.

Playback using search-term, nextup, resume and some weird playlist mode.

___

To-Do list:

+ think of other *useful* features that require **0** effort to implement
