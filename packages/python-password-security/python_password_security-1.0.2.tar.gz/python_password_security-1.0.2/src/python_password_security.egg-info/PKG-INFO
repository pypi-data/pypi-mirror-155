Helps you make sure your passwords follow [NSA's Network Infrastructure Security Guidance](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Mar/01/2002947139/-1/-1/0/CTR_NSA_NETWORK_INFRASTRUCTURE_SECURITY_GUIDANCE_20220301.PDF)

### Note: This project is by no way, shape, or form involved with the NSA. It just took inspiration from their guidance.

-   Free software: MIT license
-   Documentation: <https://python-password-security.readthedocs.io>.

# Features

Checks if your password has been cracked before against a database of [11.8 billion breached passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/). 
Checks if your password includes capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Checks if your password is a keyboard walk (hint: they are highly insecure and not smart at all!)
Allows you to disable any of the security measures if you like to take risks!

# Credits

This package was coded in it\'s entirety by Aria Bagheri. But you can always contribute if you want! Just fork the project, have your go at it, and then submit a pull request!
Special thanks to our heroes at the NSA, without their super comprehensive guidance, this library would not exist! Their recommendations are awesome, and I suggest following most of them! 
Special thanks to folks at haveibeenpwned.com, the FBI, and the NCA. Without their amazing work, this project would lack a good database of pwned passwords to check against.
Also, thanks to Rich Kelley for providing the open source community with the keyboard walk algorithm. While it still is a proof of concept, it saved me a lot of time, and tears.
