# Larryc
Larryc is a dictionary-search engine that runs in your terminal with a pleasing UI. Larryc is depending on the [dictionary api](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). And, the UI is written in [Rich framework](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).

## Purpose
First of all, nobody these days carries dictionaries. Second of all, not everyone likes to use the browser for everything. Especially me. I feel like small things like this should be done in the terminal, which is fast and straight to point. Larryc is **maybe** going to solve the *dictionary* crysis. That's what I'm calling it. 

## Installation
Windows (native executable):
- Download the executable from the release tab. 
- Create a new folder and put the **exe** into the folder.
- Copy the path of the folder containing the executable.
- Put the path into your environment PATH variable.
- Now you can call larryc through your terminal using `larryc`.
Cross-platform (Python must be installed):
- Open up your terminal. And type in: `$ pip install larryc`.
- Restart your terminal session and access larryc through `larryc`.
