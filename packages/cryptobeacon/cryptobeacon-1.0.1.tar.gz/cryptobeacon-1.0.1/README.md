CryptoBeacon is a simple command-line interface tool for cryptocurrency alerts directly into your desktop. It uses the free [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) to obtain the current prices, sending desktop notification when alarm price targets are reached. The application is built in [Python](https://www.python.org/), with the help of [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) and [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).
