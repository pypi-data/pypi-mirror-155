This project allows you to connect your Python scripts to a standalone "mouse brain renderer" program, to create graphics like the ones above.

# Quickstart

To install the package run `pip install unityneuro` to get started open a Python terminal and run:

```
import unityneuro.render as urn
urn.setup()
urn.set_area_visibility({"grey":True})
```
