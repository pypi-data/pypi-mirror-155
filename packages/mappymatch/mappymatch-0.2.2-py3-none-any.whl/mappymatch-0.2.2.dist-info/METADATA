# mappymatch
mappymatch is a pure-python package developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory that maintains a collection of map matching algorithms and wrappers. The package was designed for ease of use and portabilty across platforms.

## Installation 

Check out [the docs](https://mappymatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/install.html) for install instructions.

## Example Usage

The current primary workflow is to use [osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) to download a road network and match it using the `LCSSMatcher`.

The `LCSSMatcher` implements the map matching algorithm described in this paper:

[Zhu, Lei, Jacob R. Holden, and Jeffrey D. Gonder.
"Trajectory Segmentation Map-Matching Approach for Large-Scale, High-Resolution GPS Data."
Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board 2645 (2017): 67-75.](https://doi.org/10.3141%2F2645-08)

usage:
```python
from mappymatch import root
from mappymatch.matchers.lcss.lcss import LCSSMatcher
from mappymatch.utils.geo import geofence_from_trace
from mappymatch.maps.nx.readers.osm_readers import read_osm_nxmap
from mappymatch.constructs.trace import Trace

trace = Trace.from_csv(root() / "resources/traces/sample_trace_1.csv")

# generate a geofence polygon that surrounds the trace; units are in meters;
# this is used to query OSM for a small map that we can match to
geofence = geofence_from_trace(trace, padding=1e3)

# uses osmnx to pull a networkx map from the OSM database
road_map = read_osm_nxmap(geofence)

matcher = LCSSMatcher(road_map)

matches = matcher.match_trace(trace)
```

## Example Notebooks

Example JupyterLab notebooks making use of mappymatch can be found in the [mappymatch examples repository](https://github.com/NREL/mappymatch-examples).
