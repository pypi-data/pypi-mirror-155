class Challenge:

    Representation of a challenge. A challenge represent the user's Captcha

    This class takes cares of:

    It frees your mind from managing all the process of a captcha challenge, keeping
    your code short and easy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    generator : Generator
        The generator class to use.
        You cannot uses :py:obj:`discapty.generators.Generator`
        directly, you must subclass it and implement the "generate" function first.

    challenge_id : Optional[int | str]
        The id of the challenge. Can be a string or an id.
        If none is supplied, a random `UUID`_ will be generated.

    retries : Optional[int]
        The number of retries allowed. Defaults to 3.

    code : Optional[str]
        The code to use. If none is supplied, a random code will be generated.

    code_length : int
        The length of the code to generate if no code is supplied. Defaults to 4.
