# Publish Markdown files to Confluence wiki

Contributors to software projects typically write documentation in Markdown format and host Markdown files in collaborative version control systems (VCS) such as GitHub or GitLab to track changes and facilitate the review process. However, not everyone at a company has access to VCS, and documents are often circulated in Confluence wiki instead.

Replicating documentation to Confluence by hand is tedious, and a lack of automated synchronization with the project repositories where the documents live leads to outdated documentation.

This Python package
* parses Markdown files,
* converts Markdown content into the Confluence Storage Format (XHTML),
* invokes Confluence API endpoints to upload images and content.

## Features

* Sections and subsections
* Text with **bold**, *italic*, `monospace`, <ins>underline</ins> and ~~strikethrough~~
* Link to [external locations](http://example.com/)
* Ordered and unordered lists
* Code blocks (e.g. Python, JSON, XML)
* Image references (uploaded as Confluence page attachments)

## Getting started

In order to get started, you will need
* your organization URL (e.g. `https://instructure.atlassian.net`),
* your Confluence username (e.g. `levente.hunyadi@instructure.com`),
* an API key (a string of alphanumeric characters), and
* the space key (e.g. `DAP`) you are publishing content to.

These can be specified at runtime or set as Confluence environment variables (e.g. add to your `~/.profile` on Linux, or `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshenv` on MacOS):
```bash
export CONFLUENCE_DOMAIN='instructure.atlassian.net'
export CONFLUENCE_USER_NAME='levente.hunyadi@instructure.com'
export CONFLUENCE_API_KEY='0123456789abcdef'
export CONFLUENCE_SPACE_KEY='DAP'
```

On Windows, these can be set via system properties.

The tool requires appropriate permissions in Confluence in order to invoke endpoints.

### Obtaining an API token

1. Log in to https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens.
2. Click *Create API token*.
3. From the dialog that appears, enter a memorable and concise *Label* for your token and click *Create*.
4. Click *Copy to clipboard*, then paste the token to your script, or elsewhere to save.
