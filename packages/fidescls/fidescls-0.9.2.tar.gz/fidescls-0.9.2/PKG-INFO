Description: # Installation from PyPI
        
        Fidescls is available as an independent package [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fidescls/).
        
        ## Basic Installation
        
        To install Fidescls as a python package, run:
        ```sh
        pip install fidescls
        ```
        
        This will install the latest version that has been published to PyPi.
        
        ### Dependencies
        Fidescls depends on [Spacy trained pipelines](https://spacy.io/models/en)
        which must be installed after running the pip install mentioned above.
        In particular, the required trained pipelines are: `en_core_web_sm`,
        and `en_core_web_lg`.  These can be installed by executing the following
        commands in the environment in which Fidescls has been installed:
        
        ```bash
        python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
        
        python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
        ```
        
        ## Next Steps
        Once installed, you may use the [fidescls module](../guides/module.md) to begin classifying PII within your own projects.
