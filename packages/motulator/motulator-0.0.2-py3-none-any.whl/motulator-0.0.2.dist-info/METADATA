# *motulator*
*motulator*: Motor Drive Simulator in Python

Introduction
------------
This open-source software includes simulation models for an induction motor, a synchronous reluctance motor, and a permanent-magnet synchronous motor. The motor models are simulated in the continuous-time domain while the control algorithms run in discrete time. The default solver is the explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4) from scipy.integrate.solve_ivp. Simple control algorithms are provided as examples.

Usage
-----
An example script `main.py` exemplifies how to configure and simulate different models. More detailed documentation will be provided quite soon...
