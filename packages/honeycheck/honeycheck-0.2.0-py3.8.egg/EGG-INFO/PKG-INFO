# HoneyCheck - Detect Rogue DHCP Servers in your network

![Honeycheck logo](assets/honeycheck_horizontal.png)

Honeycheck detects rogue dhcp servers and provides a modular and fully
configurable action environment in case they are found.

If you want a quick setup and you have a Raspberry-Pi go directly to [Raspberry
Pi Images section](#raspberry-pi-images).

## System requirements

```bash
apt-get install -y python3 virtualenv bridge-utils tcpdump
```

## System configuration

HoneyCheck needs to configure the interface that we are going to configure in
bridge mode.

This can be configured in the /etc/network/interfaces file:
https://wiki.debian.org/BridgeNetworkConnections#Configuring_bridging_in_.2Fetc.2Fnetwork.2Finterfaces

In the following text, it goes from there with the adaptation that in our case
we only want to make a bridge per interface to be able to control them
independently.

## Honeycheck Installation

```bash
pip install honeycheck
```

## Running Honeycheck

Once configured, we restart the networking service and proceed to configure the
application.

Once Honeycheck is configured it can be started running `python3 -m honeycheck
-c our_conf_file.ini`
