class NoValueFound(AttributeError):

    The default exception raised when no value can be found for a parameter.

    BYOC tries to avoid raising or interpreting any exceptions relating to 
    accessing parameter values.  Instead, user-provided callbacks are expected 
    to raise if they notice something wrong.  This puts the user in control of 
    exception handling and error messages, both good things for a 
    general-purpose framework like this.

    `NoValueFound` is a bit of an exception to this philosophy.  It's raised by 
    the default picker (`first`) in the event that no values were found for an 
    parameter.  It's interpreted by some parts of BYOC (specifically the 
    `Method` and `Func` getters) to mean that an attempt to get a value should 
    be silently skipped.  Both of these behaviors can be overridden, but 
    they're useful defaults.

    A record of the search for a parameter value.

    Messages are added to the log using the ``+=`` operator::

        >>> log = Log()

    Each message can either be a string or a no-argument callable returning a 
    string.  The callables will be evaluated just before the log is displayed, 
    and can be used to defer the construction of strings that are likely to be 
    expensive and/or unlikely to be useful.  For example, it's common to use 
    callables to log when a value is successfully found, because (i) the log is 
    usually only displayed in cases where no value is found and (ii) formatting 
    arbitrary objects could be expensive.
