# hpc-sdk
sdk for hpc app of EU Materials-MarketPlace

## To activate an MarkectPlace account for using hpc-app

1. Having an account on MarketPlace and purchase hpc-app.
2. Send me the email of account and I will add it to whitelist of app.
3. https://mp-hpc.herokuapp.com/register with MarketPlace token which will create data repo (a remote folder) in HPC resource and mapping the user name to hpc server database where the jobs and users are storing. Currently it is in `/scratch/snx3000/jyu/firecrest/<prefer_name>/`. (TODO: this will be a view form in frontpage.)
4. Happy computing.

## How to call capabilities?

(TODO: update after integrate with Python-SDK)
