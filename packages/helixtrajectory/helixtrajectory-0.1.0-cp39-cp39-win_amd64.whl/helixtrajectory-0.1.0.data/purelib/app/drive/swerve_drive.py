class swerve_drive:
    """
        This class represents a swerve drive robot. It includes the physical properties necessary to
        accurately model the dynamics of the system. To understand this implementation, some definitions
        are required.
        
        When properties for each module are listed, they are always in the order of
        [front_left, front_right, rear_left, rear_right].

        Related to the 2D coordinate system of the field, the robot coordinate system is defined with its
        center placed on the center of the robot, and the x-axis points directly towards the front face
        of the robot. The y-axis points 90 degress counter-clockwise. The following diagram shows the
        coordinate system and some related dimensions:

        The nonrotating robot coordinate system is defined with the same center as the robot coordinate
        system, but it does not rotate and its axes always point in the same directions as the field
        coordinate system.
