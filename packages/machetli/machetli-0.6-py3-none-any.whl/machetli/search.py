def search(initial_state, successor_generator, evaluator_path, environment=None):
    """Start a machetli search and return the resulting state.

    The search is started from *initial_state*, which is a dictionary
    describing the initial conditions of what you want to minimize.

    *successor_generator* is a single :class:`SuccessorGenerator
    <machetli.planning.generators.SuccessorGenerator>` or a list of
    SuccessorGenerators. If a list [s1, ..., sn] is given, the search
    first tries all successors from s1, then from s2, and so on.

    *evaluator_path* is the path to a Python file that contains a function
    *evaluate(state)* that is used to check if the behaviour that the search
    is analyzing is still present in the state. The function has to take a single
    parameter that is the state of the search as a dictionary like the one given
    to *search* as the *initial_state* parameter. It has to return True if the
    behaviour is present and False otherwise.

    *environment* determines whether the search should be done on a local
    machine or on a Slurm computing grid. Use
    :class:`machetli.environments.LocalEnvironment` or an implementation
    of :class:`machetli.environments.SlurmEnvironment`. If no environment
    is specified, a local environment will be used.

    Example usage:

TODO: update line numbers and filename
    .. literalinclude:: ../examples/issue335_pddl/local_test.py
        :language: python
        :caption:
        :lines: 18-30
        :emphasize-lines: 9-12

    Note that *initial_state* is never checked to have the evaluated property.
    Consequently, if the result of the search is identical to the initial state,
    this can have two reasons: (1) the initial state is minimal with respect to
    the evaluated property and the used successor generators, or (2) the initial
    state does not have the property and neither does any of its successors. (If
    a successor has the property despite the initial state not having it,
    Machetli will nevertheless minimize the task as intended.)
