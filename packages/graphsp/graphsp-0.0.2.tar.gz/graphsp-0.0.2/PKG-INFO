Description: # Graphsp
        
        ## Project description
        This project implements algorithms associated with ` Graph Data Structure `.
        
        The following is the list of algorithm this library implements:
        
        - Breadth First Search
        - Depth First Search
        - Dijkstra (Single Source Shortest Path)
        - Floyd Warshall (All Pairs Shortest Path)
        
        ## Installation
        ` pip install graphsp `
        
        ## Usage
        ` from graphsp import Graph `
        
        Initializing graph object
        ```
        graph = graphsp.Graph(n, graph_type)
        ```
        n = Total number of nodes
        graph_type = directed / undirected [in string]
        
        
        Initializing & Populating the graph
        ```
        graph = graphsp.Graph(5, "undirected")
        
        graph.bulk_link([(0, 4, 5), (0, 1, 1), (1, 4, 3),
                         (1, 3, 1), (1, 2, 15), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 3)])
        ```
        
        Using different algorithms
        ```
        fw = FloydWarshall(n, graph)
        print(fw.floyd_warshall())
        
        dfs = DFS(n, graph)
        print(dfs.dfs(start_node))
        
        bfs = BFS(n, graph)
        print(bfs.bfs(start_node))
        
        dj = Dijkstra(n, graph)
        print(dj.dijkstra(start_node))
        ```
        n = Total number of nodes
        start_node = Number on the desired starting node
        graph = Object of Graph class
