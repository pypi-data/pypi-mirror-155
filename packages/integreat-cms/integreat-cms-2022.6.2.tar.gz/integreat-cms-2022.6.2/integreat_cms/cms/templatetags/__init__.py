"""
Template tags are our custom extension of the :doc:`ref/templates/builtins` of :doc:`ref/templates/language`.

Tags are used to provide arbitrary logic in the rendering process and are surrounded by ``{%`` and ``%}``.
Filters transform the values of variables and are surrounded by ``{{`` and ``}}``.

See :doc:`howto/custom-template-tags` for more information.
