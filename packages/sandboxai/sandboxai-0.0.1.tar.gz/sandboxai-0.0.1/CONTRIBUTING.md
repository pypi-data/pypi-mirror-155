# Development

## Software Requirements

Aside from an editor (preferably VS Code), Git and Python, that is all you really need for this.

## IDE Configuration

> **First run the `admin/scripts/new_here.py` script to set up pre-commit hooks and dependencies. It would be helpful to rerun this from time to time as new pre-commit hooks are added.** 

- *Please test before commit.*
- *Please use tabs, not spaces.*

### Concerning VS Code Users

If you are a user of Visual Studio Code, you'll find a VS Code configuration with tasks for setup and testing. Please use these, and, if you don't, please do not delete or edit them directly.

There are also a few selected VS Code Extensions that should help, which should come up as workspace recommendations in the VS Code extension tab.

### Terminal Locations

Just a practical note, it helps to have the terminal navigated to the root of the project for running code. It may not otherwise work.

### Important note about the website
If working on the website in the docs folder, please <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> (vscode open folder shortcut) into the docs folder.

### Repo Branching
Whether you're working on the main repo or a personal fork, please ensure that you branch it, rather than directly using the master branch, to prevent issues with breaking production. Please name branches all in lower case with dashes with verbose, descriptive names following the following conventions.

| Prefix | Use Case | Example |
| ------ | -------- | ------- |
| `add` | Adding something new | `add-genetic-algorithm-genomes` |
| `improve` | Improving efficiency or design / refactoring | `improve-knn-fit-efficiency` |
| `fix` | Fixing bugs or issues | `fix-security-issue-14` |

## Code Style

Please refer to the following documents for code styles.

| Language | Style File                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Python   | [admin/python.md](admin/style/python.md) |
