Installation
============


Pre-requisites
--------------

Python
^^^^^^

To install **PacBio Data Processing**, a Python interpreter is needed
in your system since the package is written in Python. The recommended
version of Python is ``3.9``. Strictly speaking the code should work
with a less recent versions, but some dependencies will require anyway
``Python-3.9``.

If you are using Linux, it is likely that Python is
already present in your system. Check it out with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python --version

or

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 --version

You know that Python is in your system if you get as output something
like (your mileage may vary):

.. code-block:: console

    Python 3.9.6

.. admonition:: Installing Python

    If you don't have Python, or you have an old version, you can either
    use your system's package manager to install a recent version of Python,
    or visit the official `Python`_ site, where there is a link to
    `Download Python`_. Then install Python using the downloaded file.

    If you download the *sources* (typically a file ending in ``.tgz``,
    ``.tar.xz`` or similar) the procedure is relatively simple:

    1. *untar* the file. For instance:

       .. prompt:: bash

	  tar xf Python-3.9.7.tgz

    2. Enter in the created directory with the sources:

       .. prompt:: bash

	  cd Python-3.9.7

    3. Open the ``README.rst`` file and follow the instructions in its
       *Build Instructions* section. They schematically amount to:

       .. prompt:: bash

	  ./configure
	  make
	  make install

       but the ``README.rst`` file gives some useful hints.

    In case you need/want to learn more about the installation process,
    you might be interested in reading this `Python installation guide`_.


.. _other-dependencies:

Other dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**PacBio Data Processing** delegates some tasks to external tools.
Therefore, the next is a list of *external dependencies*:

- :ref:`kineticsTools`
- :ref:`pbindex`
- :ref:`blasr`
- :ref:`ccs`
- :ref:`htslib`

These dependencies **are required** to be present in your system in order
to use some tools provided by **PacBio Data Processing**. You need to
install them if they are absent in your system.


Virtual environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is *optional* but *highly recommended* to use a virtual environment
(or a variant thereof) to install **PacBio Data Processing**. In this
document we will use the standard library's ``venv`` module.

A virtual environment (or ``venv`` for short) allows us to have
the required set of packages independently of the system-wide packages
installed. This has several advantages. First, it will help you produce an
*isolated mess* in case something goes wrong, but it also allows us to
decide the version of any package we are interested in. irrespective
of what other ``venv``'s need, or what the system needs.

A ``venv`` can be created like follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3.9 -m venv PDP-py39

this line will create a folder called ``PDP-py39`` containing the ``venv``.
You can choose another name if you like.
After the installation one can activate the ``venv`` to start using it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ source PDP-py39/bin/activate

From that point on, the management of and access to Python packages 
happens *within* the ``venv``. For example, installing a new package
will be done inside the ``venv``.

Afterwards you can proceed with the installation of
**PacBio Data Processing**.

For more information on ``venv``'s, consult the documentation of that module
in the standard library `venvs`_, and references therein.

.. note::

   To stop using a ``venv``, type ``deactivate`` *in the same*
   terminal where the ``venv`` was activated.

Installing the stable release of PacBio Data Processing
-------------------------------------------------------

The latest stable release of **PacBio Data Processing** can be installed
by executing this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pacbio-data-processing

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process of installing pip.

Alternative: Installing PacBio Data Processing from a file
----------------------------------------------------------

It is also possible to install |project| from  a file: a
`tarball <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)>`_ or
a `wheel <https://pythonwheels.com/>`_.

You simply need the file and run pip on it. For instance, using as an example
a *tarball* corresponding to version ``1.0.0``, it would be:

.. prompt:: bash

   pip install PacbioDataProcessing-1.0.0.tar.gz

From a wheel it would be:

.. prompt:: bash

   pip install PacbioDataProcessing-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl


Alternative: Installing PacBio Data Processing from the repository
------------------------------------------------------------------

.. warning::
   The instructions in this section are not necessary for
   end users. If you are simply interested in using
   **PacBio Data Processing** to analyze some BAM file
   or you need to use some functionality provided by
   **PacBio Data Processing** from within your code,
   you don't necessarily need this section.
   But if you want to have access to the source
   code keep reading.

The sources for **PacBio Data Processing** can be downloaded from the `GitLab repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://gitlab.com/dvelazquez/pacbio-data-processing

and install it with:

.. prompt:: bash

    pip install ./pacbio-data-processing


Or download the tarball:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -OJL https://gitlab.com/dvelazquez/pacbio-data-processing/-/archive/master/pacbio_data_processing-master.zip

and install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pacbio_data_processing-master.zip
