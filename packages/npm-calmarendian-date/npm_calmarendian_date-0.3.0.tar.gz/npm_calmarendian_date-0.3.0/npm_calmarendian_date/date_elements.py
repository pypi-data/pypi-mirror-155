Date Element Classes

Internally, CalmarendianDate uses the Grand Cycle Notation (GCN) which is a five-element date format consisting of
GrandCycle, CycleInGrandCycle, Season, Week and Day.
Written down, GCN is simply a list of integers but each element has its own verification rules,
derivable properties and, in some instances, name attributes.
There are, therefore, separate classes for each of these elements, and it is instances of these classes that
CalmarendianDate uses, rather than the raw integer values.
