# Calmarendian Date
## What is It?
**npm_calmarendian_date** is a Python package that provides a `CalmarendianDate` class for the *Calendar of Lorelei* in the same way the Python Standard Library provides a `date` class for the Gregorian Calendar.

## The Calendar of Lorelei
The planet of [Calmarendi](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/calmarendi-natasha-moorfield/a/calmarendi-article) takes, from the perspective of an observer from Earth, seven years to orbit its star. The [Calendar of Lorelei](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/calmarendi-natasha-moorfield/a/the-calendar-of-lorelei-article), which divides this orbital period into seven seasons of fifty weeks of seven days (plus a few days added on to keep everything lined up) is what Calmarendians use to keep track of time.

## Where to Get It

pip install npm-calmarendian-date

from npm_calmarendian_date import CalmarendianDate
